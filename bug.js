```javascript
//tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-color': '#f0f0f0',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
This configuration attempts to define a custom color `custom-color`, but it might not work if the `content` property is not correctly configured to include the files where this color is used. If your custom color isn't being applied, it might be because Tailwind isn't processing the files where it's defined.
